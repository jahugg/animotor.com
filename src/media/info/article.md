Animotor is a collaborative graphic design studio run by Pablo Hintermüller and Stephan Geiger. Since small children we wanted to be rockstars and athletes, well now we are rocking computers and have sporty brains. We are fascinated by the power of shapes, stories, moving images, music, arts and some other things <sup>1</sup>. In these fields we feel home and we love to push our imagination to the next level. In close cooperation with our clients, we develop concepts and create products in the wide field of visual matters <sup>2</sup>.
